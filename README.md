Developed a machine learning model in Python using modules such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn to predict
studentsâ€™ final math grades. I Implemented a successful linear regression approach with a prediction accuracy of 89% and using that model to
visualize trends using matplotlib. Used different variables to see what effect it would have on the final performance.
